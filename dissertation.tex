%            for use with the              %

% This is an adapted version of J.J. Charfman's template which can be
% found here: https://da.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-arizona-astronomy-thesis-template/tsfqcgnfmjcx
% This template is adapted for linguistics, with support for XeLaTeX, duly tested on . The uncommented line
% below will produce a Dissertation, the others would produce a Thesis
% or a Document.  There are other options available to you like turning
% on the copyright statement and replacing the year on the title page
% with a "generated on" stamp (handy for early drafts).  To find out
% what the available options are, take a look into the uathesis.cls
% file and look for the \DeclareOption commands near the top of that
% file.
% There are five copyright options.  Copyright, no copyright, and three
% different Creative Commons licences.  Use the one you want (If you go
% Creative Commons, I (DM) think the CC-BY-ND makes the most sense)  See
% uathesis.cls for the reason why the non-commercial licenses are not
% included.

%%############ PDFLATEX FONT SUPPORT ############
%%Uncomment this section if your compiler is PDFLATEX
%%inputenc allows you to directly input utf-8 characters. This means you can just type Árüz instead of \'Ar\"uz:

%% LaTeX has two bibliography compiling systems, natbib and biber. Choose the one that you intend to use:

%% 1. NATBIB:
%% natbib is available on most systems, and is
					% terribly handy.
					% We are using biber for this template, but leaving natbib in as an option
                    % if you want to use natbib instead of biber/biblatex, you need to 
                    % comment out the next package and the % addbibresource params
% \usepackage{natbib}
% \setcitestyle{semicolon,aysep={},yysep={,},notesep={:}} 

%% 2. BIBER:
\usepackage[backend=biber,
                style=unified, % we are using the LSA unified style sheet here
                maxcitenames=2,

                natbib]{bib latex}
\addbibresource{bibliography.bib}
\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

%% ###################### TODONOTES #######################
%% Use one of the following two package invocations. The first is for the final version, the second for adding todonotes and comments:

%% 1. DISABLE TODONOTES:
%\usepackage[disable]{todonotes}
%% 2. ENABLE TODONOTES:
\usepackage[colorinlistoftodos,backgroundcolor= yellow, bordercolor= black]{todonotes}
    \setuptodonotes{inline, prepend, caption={ToDo}}
%% #######################################
	

% If you are using hyper-ref (recommended), this command must go after all 
% other package inclusions (from the hyperref package documentation).
% The purpose of hyperref is to make the PDF created extensively
% cross-referenced.
%allows to use references as links [hidelinks] makes sure there are no borders around the link, gives us \autoref
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

%% ########## Linguistics Packages ############
\usepackage{tikz} %graph solution that should help me get a nice vowel chart
\usepackage{tipa} %enables an IPA environment
\usepackage{qtree} %allows simple trees
\usepackage[linguistics]{forest} %allows more complex trees
\usepackage{gb4e} %manages example numbering, has to be last package in pre-amble, will break document otherwise

%% ########## Set up values for Title Page ############
 
\completetitle{Title}
\fullname{}			% Grad college wants your full name here.
\degreename{Doctor of Philosophy}	% Title of your degree.
\degreemajor{Linguistics} % Degree major

\counterwithout{footnote}{chapter} %disable this if you want your footnotes to reset their counter for each chapter

% the inlinetitle below will be used on the graduate college signature page if you uncomment it. 
% This is useful if your completetitle uses a linebreak or other command that would break an inline use of that title. 
% If you leave this commented it will do nothing. Uncomment and give it a value to activate. The change will be visible on page 2.

%\inlinetitle{}

\begin{document}

\include{custom-commands.tex} % we are hosting all the custom commands we are writing in a seperate file

% tocdepth defines how many layers of sections/subsections are displayed in your table of content. The hierarchy works like this:
% Chapters (1)> Sections (2) > Subsections (3) > SubSubsections (4) > Paragraphs (5)
% Default = 4
%\setcounter{tocdepth}{5} 
% secnumdepth does the same work, except it numbers your sections. Chapters are automatically numbered, so setting this to 4 will give you numbered paragraphs. Default = 3
%\setcounter{secnumdepth}{4}



% Set up the title page
\maketitlepage
{DEPARTMENT OF LINGUISTICS}	% Title of your department.
{2019}							

% Insert the approval form.  Note that for electronic submission
% of your Ph. D. dissertation, you must bring *two* copies of the
% approval page to your final defense.  These must be signed by
% the committee.  Make two photocopies: one for the department
% and the other for your records.  Then, bring the two signed 
% originals to the graduate college when you submit the 
% final version of the dissertation to the University of Arizona.
% if you want to change the number of lines displayed, you need to do this in the uathesis.cls class, check the \approval command
\approval
{}		% Defense Date	
{}	% Dissertation Director
{}	% 1st committee member
{}		% 2nd committee member
{}		% 3rd committee member
{}		% 4th committee member

% \approvalWithWM{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}

% Include the ``Statement by Author'' for Dissertations
\statementbyauthor
% If this is a Thesis, use the following form, with your thesis director's
% name and title in the square brackets like so (you should also omit the 
% approval form insertion above):
%\statementbyauthor[Jane M. Doe\\Professor of Chemistry]

\incacknowledgements{sections/acknowledgements}

% Include the ``Dedication''
\incdedication{sections/dedication}

% this is where your natbib stylesheet is referenced
%\bibliographystyle{sp-lsa.bst}	% S\&P bibliography style
% S\&P, an LSA publication, meets the LSA guidelines.  
% if you wish to use the UA citation style instead, call "uabibnat.bst" in the \bibliographystyle
%\bibliography{bibliography}

%% use this for biblatex/biber
%% 'title = ' changes the heading of the bibliography section,
%% and 'heading = ' ensures it is listed in the ToC 
    \printbibliography[title = {REFERENCES}, heading=bibintoc]
